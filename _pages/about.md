[Adaptive Channel Sparsity for Federated Learning under System Heterogeneity](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

**Dongping Liao**, Xitong Gao, Yiren Zhao, Chengzhong Xu

- We figure out the coupling effect of data and system heterogeneity under federated training, namely, the gradient deviation. We propose Flado, which is equipped with adaptive channel sparsity layer to address the conflicting gradient updates among client models.
