Dongping Liao (廖东平) is now a postdoc researcher at University of Macau. In 2024, he received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, China. Before that, he received B.S. (2016) and M.S. (2019) degrees in the School of Astronautics from Beihang University, during which he dedicated on cooperative perception and planing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Robots (Multi-agent System). 
His current research interests include distributed optimization, class imbalance learning and multi-modal models.

[Progressive Distribution Matching for Federated Semi-supervised Learning](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/32551)

**Dongping Liao**, Xitong Gao, Yabo Xu, Chengzhong Xu,

- We observe the distribution mismatch phenomenon of federated semi-supervised learning and propose to leverage Optimal Transport to align the distribution of unlabeled data.

[Impartial Adversarial Distillation: Addressing Biased Data-free Knowledge Distillation via Adaptive Constrained Optimization](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28120)

**Dongping Liao**, Xitong Gao, Chengzhong Xu

- We observe an interesting phenomenon when exploring the *biased adversarial data-free knowledge distillation* problem, which has a diverse impact on different groups of synthetic data. We put forward an adaptive constrained optimization framework to balance the KL divergence of the majority and minority classes.

[Adaptive Channel Sparsity for Federated Learning under System Heterogeneity](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liao_Adaptive_Channel_Sparsity_for_Federated_Learning_Under_System_Heterogeneity_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)

**Dongping Liao**, Xitong Gao, Yiren Zhao, Chengzhong Xu

- We figure out the coupling effect of data and system heterogeneity under federated training, namely, the gradient deviation among client models. We propose Flado, which is equipped with adaptive channel sparsity layers to address the conflicting gradient problem while achieving computational efficiency.
